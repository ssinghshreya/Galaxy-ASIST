# Galaxy-ASIST
Galaxy-ASIST (Antimicrobial Susceptibility Standards) is a web-based platform that allows for the characterization of clinical isolates based on three international standards-MIC breakpoints, phenotypic classification, genome quality. The platform also offers subsequent fine mapping of antimicrobial-resistant determinants.
